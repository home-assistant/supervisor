# Hass.io

## First private cloud solution for home automation

Hass.io is a Docker-based system for managing your Home Assistant installation
and related applications. The system is controlled via Home Assistant which
communicates with the Supervisor. The Supervisor provides an API to manage the
installation. This includes changing network settings or installing
and updating software.
