In some cases, this network isolation can limit add-ons in providing their services and therefore, the isolation can be lifted by the add-on author, giving the add-on full access to the network capabilities of the host machine. This gives the add-on more networking capabilities but lowers the security, hence, the security rating of the add-on will be lowered when this option is used by the add-on.","addon.dashboard.capability.homeassistant_api.title":"Home Assistant API Access","addon.dashboard.capability.homeassistant_api.description":"This add-on is allowed to access your running Home Assistant instance directly via the Home Assistant API.
